This is an address book application for lawyers who prefer typing using CLI, the application was designed with this target audience in mind.

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Notarius_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Notarius Product Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-t17-1.github.io/tp)**.
* It is named `Notarius` and it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
