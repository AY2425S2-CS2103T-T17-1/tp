| Blank Inputs          | Inputs entered by you that are either empty or only contain whitespace characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| GUI                   | Stands for graphical user interface. It is a visual way of interacting with Notarius via menus, lists, buttons, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Parameter             | A parameter is a piece of information you give to a command so Notarius knows what to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Features

### Understanding Command Formats

#### Command Words
Each command starts with a command word, such as `add`, `list`, `exit`, etc.
<br>
A command word tells Notarius what action you want to perform, like adding a client contact or listing all client contacts.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note about command words:**
<br>
Commands words are case sensitive. 
<br>
Always type command words exactly as shown.<br>
<br>
Example:  `add` command word is different from `Add` or `ADD`.
</div>

#### Parameters
Parameters are written in `UPPER_CASE`. These are placeholders you replace with your own info.
<br>
<br>
Example: In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note about parameters:**
<br>
Parameters can be in any order.<br>
<br>
Example: If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`,
`p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
</div>

#### Optional Parameters
Items in square brackets are optional. It means you do not have to include this piece of information
if you do not want to.
<br>
<br>
Examples: `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

#### ... Parameters
Items with `…`​ after them. You can use it once, multiple, or not at all.
<br>
<br>
Examples: 
`n/NAME [t/TAG]…​` can be used as
<br>
No Tag:
`n/NAME`
<br>
One Tag:
`t/case44`
<br>
Many Tags:
`t/case44 t/personal injury`
`t/case44 t/personal injury t/referred`


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note about parameters:**
<br>
Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit`, `undo` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
<br>
Example: if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Basic Features

#### Viewing help : `help`

The `help` command provides guidance on how to use the application, including available commands and their formats.

Format: `help [COMMAND]`

`COMMAND` is the command word of the command you are trying to get help for.

There are two ways to use the help command:

| Formats                               | Purpose                          |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `help`          | Displays usage for all commands. |
| `help COMMAND` | Displays specific command usage. |


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Constraint:**
<br>
The `COMMAND` must be a valid command word.
</div>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**<br>
Case-insensitive command lookup (e.g.`help FiNd` works for `find`).
</div>


Examples:
* `help` displays the usage of all commands.
* `help add` displays the correct format and usage of the `add` command.
* `help me` returns: `"Unknown command! Use 'help' to see available commands.`

#### Adding a client contact: `add`

Adds a client contact to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Constraints:**<br>
* A client contact is considered a duplicate if another client contact has the same email(case-insensitive)
and this duplicate email will be rejected.<br><br>
* Phone number must be a number with 3 to 15 digits.
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/DUI e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/case44`

#### Listing all client contacts : `list`

Shows a list of all contacts in the address book.

Format: `list`

#### Editing a client contact : `edit`

Updates an existing client contact in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG] [t/ADDITIONAL TAG]…​`

* Edits the client contact at the specified `INDEX`. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Constraints:**<br>
* A client contact is considered a duplicate if another client contact has the same email(case-insensitive)
and this duplicate email will be rejected.<br><br>
* Phone number must be a number with 3 to 15 digits.<br><br>
* You must provide at least one of the optional details to update.<br><br>
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Notes about editing client contacts:**
* Any details you change will replace the old ones.<br><br>
* If you edit tags, the old tags are removed and replaced with the new ones.<br><br>
* To remove all tags, you can type t/ without adding any tag name after it.
</div>


Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st contact to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 3 t/Custody t/Case45` Overwrite the currents tag(s) of the 3rd contact with `Custody` and `Case45`.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd contact to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.


#### Locating client contacts by name: `find`

The `find` command allows you to search for contacts based on their name,
phone number, email, address, or tags.

Format: `find [n/"NAME" "MORE_NAMES"] [p/"PHONE" "MORE_PHONES"]
[e/"EMAIL" "MORE_EMAILS"] [a/"ADDRESS" "MORE_ADDRESSES"]
[t/"TAG" "MORE_TAGS"] `




<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Constraints:**<br>
* Use double quotation marks (") around each keyword to ensure correct parsing. <br><br>
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g the name `hans` will match `Hans`
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Notes about finding client contacts:**
* You can search by `name`, `phone number`, `email`, `address`, or `tags`.<br><br>
* Allows small typos for `name`, `email` and `address` fields:
    - e.g. Searching for `David av` will match `David Li`.
    - Searching for `Bbo@example.com` will match `Bob@example.com.`
* Supports OR search: At least one field must match any of the provided keywords.<br><br>
* If no prefix (e.g. n/) is given, find by name is assumed.
    * e.g. `find Alice Bernice` is treated as `find n/"Alice" "Bernice"`<br><br>
* Supports multiple entries per field:
    - e.g. `find n/"Alice" "Bob" p/"98765432" "91234567"`,
      matches contacts named `Alice` or `Bob`, or with phone numbers `98765432` or `91234567`.
</div>

Examples:
* `find Alex` returns `Alex Yeoh`
* `find p/"87438807" "91031282"` returns `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li`
* `find n/"Alxe" "Davdi"` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>


#### Deleting client contact(s) : `delete`

Deletes specified **client** contact(s) from your list of contacts in Notarius.

To speed up clearing out your client contacts, **Notarius** allows deleting multiple client contacts quickly,
depending on your needs: 

| Formats                                               | Purpose                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single-delete: `delete INDEX`                         | Deletes a **single** client contact at the specified INDEX                                                |
| Ranged-delete: `delete i/START_INDEX-END_INDEX`       | Deletes **consecutive** client contacts whose indexes are between `START_INDEX` to `END_INDEX` inclusive. |
| Spaced-delete: `delete i/FIRST_INDEX [MORE_INDEXES]…` | Deletes multiple client contacts from **different** parts of the client contact list by their indexes     |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

When deleting contacts with same tags, consider using the **find command** followed by **ranged-delete** to speed things up.

</div>

Examples:

* **Single-delete Format:**
    * `list` followed by `delete 2`
        * Deletes the 2nd client contact displayed in the list of client contacts from the top.
    * `find n/"Betsy"` followed by `delete 1`
        * Deletes the 1st client contact in the displayed results of the `find` command.

* **Ranged-delete Format:**
    * `list` followed by `delete i/1-2`
        * Deletes the 1st and 2nd client contacts in the list of client contacts from the top.
    * `find n/"Alex"` followed by `delete i/1-2`
        * Deletes the 1st and 2nd client contacts in the displayed results of the `find` command.

* **Spaced-delete Format:**
    * `list` followed by `delete i/1 2 3`
        * Deletes the 1st, 2nd and 3rd client contacts in the list of client contacts from the top.



![deleteIndexSpaced](images/deleteIndexSpaced.png)

<div style="text-align:center;">
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Example:</span> Deleting the first 3 client contacts after <code>list</code> using
<code>delete i/1-3</code>
</div>

<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Index constraints:**<br>

* The indexes must refer to the index numbers shown in the displayed client contacts list.

* The indexes **must be a positive integer** from 1, 2, 3, …

* All specified indexes must correspond to some index number shown in the displayed client contacts list, otherwise the command fails.

* For ranged and spaced delete formats, duplicate indexes specified will be treated *as-if* that index was specified only once.

* Up to 100 **unique** indexes (duplicates are not part of this count!) can be specified (either via spaced or ranged delete formats); beyond which the command will fail.

* At least 1 index should be specified when using ranged or spaced delete formats.

* For ranged-delete format, `START_INDEX` must be at most equal to `END_INDEX` (For e.g. `delete i/3-2` is invalid).

</div>


### Special Features

#### Sorting of client contacts : `sort`

Sort the address book by specified prefix in lexicographical order.

Format: `sort PREFIX`

* `sort n/` sorts contacts by ascending names.
* `sort p/` sorts contacts by ascending phone numbers.
* `sort e/` sorts contacts by ascending emails.
* `sort a/` sorts contacts by ascending addresses.
* `sort t/` sorts contacts by ascending tags.
* `sort t/ n/` sorts contacts by tags first, then names.
* `sort t/ p/` sorts contacts by tags first, then phone numbers.
* `sort t/ e/` sorts contacts by tags first, then emails.
* `sort t/ a/` sorts contacts by tags first, the addresses.

Examples:
* `sort n/` returns contact by ascending names `Alex`, `Bernice`, `Charlotte`.
* `sort p/` returns contact by ascending phone numbers `87438807`, `91031282`, `92492021`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about sorting:**<br>

* **Adding New Contacts:**<br>
  After performing a sort, newly added contacts will **not** automatically be inserted in the 
correct sorted order. To maintain the sorted order, you will need to run the `sort` command again after adding the new contact.

* **Sorting Multiple Tags:**<br>
  It sorts the **first tag** in **alphabetical order**.<br>
  e.g. `t/colleagues t/friends` will sort by `colleagues` tag first and followed by `friends` tag.<br>
  e.g. If `t/colleagues t/friends` and `t/lawyer t/colleagues` are sorted, `t/colleagues t/friends` will appear before
  `t/lawyer t/colleagues`, because `colleagues` tag comes first in the sorting order.
</div>


#### Pinning a client contact : `pin`

Pins the specified client contact to the top of the address book.<br>

Format: `pin INDEX`

Pins the contact at the specified `INDEX` to the top of the list.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note about pinning:**<br>
If a client contact is already pinned, and you pin them, they will still be pinned.
</div>


Examples:
* `list` followed by `pin 2` pins the 2nd contact in the address book to the top.
* `sort p/` followed by `pin 1` pins the 1st contact when sorted according to phone number.


#### Unpinning a pinned client contact : `unpin`

Unpins the specified contact from the top of the address book if they were previously pinned.<br>

Format: `unpin INDEX`

Unpins the contact at the specified `INDEX`. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note about unpinning:**<br>
If a client contact is already unpinned, and you unpin them, they will still be unpinned.
</div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `unpin 1` unpins the 1st contact in the address book.
* `sort p/` followed by `unpin 1` unpins the 1st contact when sorted according to phone number.

#### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all client contacts in the address book.

Format: `clear`

#### Adding/Changing a note : `note`

Changes a note of a client contact in the address book.

Format: `note INDEX [nt/NOTE]`

Changes the note of the client contact at the specified `INDEX`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
You can change a note into a blank note by typing `note INDEX` without a `NOTE`. 
</div>

Example:
* `note 3 nt/Away for a long time` changes the note of the 3rd client contact from the top
  in the address book into "Away for a long time".
* `sort n/` followed by `note 2` changes the note of the
  2nd client contact from the top listed in the sorted address book.
* `note 1` changes the note of the 1st client contact from the top into a blank note.

#### Viewing a note : `viewnote`

Displays the contents of a note of a particular client contact in the address book.

Format: `viewnote INDEX`

Displays the note of the client contact at the specified `INDEX`.

Example:
* `viewnote 3` displays the note of the 3rd client contact from the top.
* `viewnote 1` displays the note of the 1st client contact from the top.

#### Undoing a command : `undo`

Undoes a command.

Format: `undo`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Constraint:**<br>
There should be a previous command to undo.
</div>


Examples:
* `undo` undoes the last command.
* `pin 4` followed by `undo` undoes the pin on the 4th client contact from the top in the address book.

#### Redoing a command : `redo`

Redoes an undone command.

Format: `redo`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note about redoing:**<br>
An undone command is a previously typed command that was reversed by the `undo` command <br>
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Constraint:**<br>
There should be an undone command to redo.
</div>

Examples:
* `redo` redoes the last undone command.
* `pin 4` followed by `undo` followed by `redo` results in
  there being a pin on the 4th client contact from the top in the address book.

#### Command history

We know it can be **very annoying** to re-type commands consisting of long client details, especially due to typos.

As such, **Notarius** keeps a history of the command inputs you have entered. When the command history is open,
the inputs shown are **ordered** from the **most recently** entered input at the **top** to the **least recently**
entered input at the **bottom**. Furthermore, the **currently selected input** in the command history
is automatically entered into the input bar, as shown below:

![[commandHistoryOrder]](images/commandHistoryOrder.png)
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Example:</span> Older and newer command inputs in the command history
<br>
The <span style="font-weight:bold;">currently selected input</span> is "more recently entered command input"
</div>

<br>

You can open and navigate through this history by using various shortcuts below, depending on your operating system:

**Windows/Linux users:** Use `Ctrl + Up` key combination to scroll up the command history, and `Ctrl + Down` arrow key combinations to scroll down.

**macOS users:** Use `Ctrl + Opt + Up` and `Ctrl + Opt + Down` arrow key combinations to respectively scroll up and down instead.



<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tips:**

* Pressing **either** of the key combinations above **based on** your operating system will **open** the command history.

* You can **close** the command history by either pressing `Enter` to submit the command input, or the `Escape` key.

* Don't worry if you typed an invalid command input, simply use the command history to re-access it again. **Notarius** saves them too.

</div>

<br>

**Scrolling up** or **down** the command history simply refers to moving the **currently selected input** of the command history 
to a **more recent/newer** or **less recent/older** command input respectively.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Important Notes:**<br>

* When the **currently selected input** is at the top of the command history, scrolling up another time will bring it down to the **oldest** input at the bottom of the command history.

* Similarly, when the **currently selected input** is at the bottom of the command history, scrolling down another time brings it back to the **newest** input at the top of the command history.

</div>

<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Constraints:**<br>

* Blank inputs (including empty inputs) are not useful command inputs and won't be added.

* Restarting or closing the application will clear the command history.

* Inputs that are duplicates of the previously saved command history input will not be added another time.

* Up to 20 of your most recently entered inputs will be saved in the command history.

</div>

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

Data from Notarius is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Notarius data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
