## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

The `help` command provides guidance on how to use the application, including available commands and their formats.

Format: `help [COMMAND]`

![help_message](images/helpMessage.png)

* Display general help message when used without arguments.
* Provides specific command help with format and example of usage
  when a valid command name is specified.
* Case-insensitive command lookup (e.g.`help FiNd` works for `find`).
* Handles unknown commands gracefully, informing the user if the command does not exist.

Examples:
* `help add` displays the correct format and usage of the `add` command.
* `help me` returns: `"Unknown command! Use 'help' to see available commands.`

### Adding a client contact: `add`

Adds a client contact to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

<div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold">An example of deleting the first 3 client contacts after listing</div>

<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Index constraints:**<br>

* Duplicate indexes specified will be treated *as-if* that index was specified only once.

* Up to 100 indexes can be specified (either via spaced or ranged indexing formats); beyond which the command will fail.

* At least 1 index should be specified when using ranged or spaced indexing formats.

</div>

### Locating client contacts by name: `find`

The `find` command allows you to search for contacts based on their name,
phone number, email, address, or tags.

Format: `find [n/"NAME" "MORE_NAMES"] [p/"PHONE" "MORE_PHONES"]
[e/"EMAIL" "MORE_EMAILS"] [a/"ADDRESS" "MORE_ADDRESSES"]
[t/"TAG" "MORE_TAGS"] `

* Use double quotation marks (") around each keyword to ensure correct parsing.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g the name `hans` will match `Hans`
* You can search by `name`, `phone number`, `email`, `address`, or `tags`.
* Supports OR search: At least one field must match any of the provided keywords.
* Allows small typos for `name`, `email` and `address` fields:
    - e.g. Searching for `Alce` will match `Alice`.
    - Searching for `Bbo@example.com` will match `Bob@example.com.`
* Supports multiple entries per field:
    - e.g. `find n/"Alice" "Bob" p/"98765432" "91234567"`,
      matches contacts named `Alice` or `Bob`, or with phone numbers `98765432` or `91234567`.

Examples:
* `find p/"87438807" "91031282"` returns `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li`
* `find n/"Alxe" "Davdi"` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)


### Sorting of client contacts : `sort`

Sort the address book by specified attribute in lexicographical order.

Format: `sort [n/]`

* `sort n/` sorts contacts by ascending names.
* `sort p/` sorts contacts by ascending phone numbers.
* `sort e/` sorts contacts by ascending emails.
* `sort a/` sorts contacts by ascending addresses.
* `sort t/` sorts contacts by ascending tags.
* `sort t/ n/` sorts contacts by tags first, within the tags, sort by names.
* `sort t/ p/` sorts contacts by tags first, within the tags, sort by phone numbers.
* `sort t/ e/` sorts contacts by tags first, within the tags, sort by emails.
* `sort t/ a/` sorts contacts by tags first, within the tags, sort by addresses.

Examples:
* `sort n/` returns contact by ascending names `Alex`, `Bernice`, `Charlotte`.
* `sort p/` returns contact by ascending phone numbers `87438807`, `91031282`, `92492021`.

Notes on Adding New Contacts:
* After performing a sort, newly added contacts will **not** automatically be inserted in the correct sorted order.
* To maintain the sorted order, you will need to run the `sort` command again after adding the new contact.

Notes on Sorting Multiple Tags:
* When sorting by multiple tags, it will prioritize the **first tag** inserted as the **primary sorting criterion**.
* For example: `t/colleagues t/friends` will sort by `colleagues` tag first and followed by `friends` tag. 
* If `t/colleagues t/friends` and `t/lawyer t/colleagues` are sorted, `t/colleagues t/friends` will appear before 
`t/lawyer t/colleagues`, because `colleagues` tag comes first in the sorting order.

### Pinning a client contact : `pin`

Pins the specified client contact to the top of the address book.<br>
Does nothing if they were already pinned.

Format: `pin INDEX`

* Pins the contact at the specified `INDEX` to the top of the list.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2,3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `pin 2` pins the 2nd contact in the address book to the top.
* `sort p/` followed by `pin 1` pins the 1st contact when sorted according to phone number.

### Unpinning a pinned client contact : `unpin`

* Unpins the contact at the specified `INDEX` from the top of the list if they were previously pinned.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2,3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `unpin 1` unpins the 1st contact in the address book.

### Command history

We know it can be **very annoying** to re-type commands consisting of long client details, especially due to a small typo.

As such, Notarius keeps a history of the commands you have entered. You can navigate through the history using various shortcuts below, depending on your operating system:

**Windows/Linux users:** Use `Ctrl + Up` and `Ctrl + Down` arrow keys to cycle up and down the command history.

**MacOS users:** Use `Ctrl + Opt + Up` and `Ctrl + Opt + Down` arrow keys instead.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Command history notes:**<br>

* Invalid/Unknown commands will be considered and saved into the input history.

* The command history will not be saved when the application is closed.

* Restarting the application will reset the command history.

* Inputs that are duplicates of the previously entered input will not be added another time.

* Up to 20 of your most recently entered inputs will be saved in the command history.

* Empty or blank inputs are not considered as command inputs and thus won't be added.

</div>

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Notarius data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
