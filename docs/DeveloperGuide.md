### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, 
`PersonDetailPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` and `HelpWindow`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### List feature

The `list` command enables users to view all existing contacts from Notarius.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Ui" />
</p>

#### Implementation

1. The user inputs the command to list all contacts.
2. A `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of a `ListCommand` object.
3. The `execute` method of the `ListCommand` object invokes the `updateFilteredPersonList` and
`commitAddressBook` method of its `Model` to update and show all contacts.
4. The `execute` method of the `ListCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding
the completion of the `list` command.

### Help feature

The `help` command allows users to view general application usage instructions or specific details about a command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/HelpCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Ui" />
</p>

#### Implementation

1. The user inputs the command to request help, either as help for general help or help COMMAND_NAME for details on a specific command. 
2. A `HelpCommandParser` object invokes its `parse` method, which parses the user input:
   1. If no argument is provided, it returns a `HelpCommand` object for general help. 
   2. If a valid command name is provided, it returns a `HelpCommand` object with that command name. 
3. A `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of the `HelpCommand` object. 
4. The execute method of the HelpCommand object checks if a command name was specified:
   1. If no command name is provided, it returns a `CommandResult` containing general help instructions. 
   2. If a valid command name is provided, it retrieves the corresponding help message from a predefined command-help mapping (`COMMAND_HELP`). 
   3. If an invalid command name is provided, it returns an error message stating that the command is unknown. 
5. The `execute` method of the `HelpCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object that stores the help message or error message. 
6. The application displays the help message to the user, either in a popup window (for general help) or in the main interface (for specific commands).

### Clear feature

The `clear` command enables users to remove all existing contacts from Notarius.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Ui" />
</p>

#### Implementation

1. The user inputs the command to clear all contacts.
2. A `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of a `ClearCommand` object.
3. The `execute` method of the `ClearCommand` object invokes the `setAddressBook` and `commitAddressBook` method 
of its `Model` argument with a new `AddressBook` object which contains an empty `UniquePersonList` property.
4. The `execute` method of the `ClearCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding 
the completion of the `clear` command.

### Sort feature

The `sort` command enables users to sort contacts in Notarius by prefix in lexicographical order.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Ui" />
</p>

#### Implementation

1. The user inputs the command to sort contacts with the specified prefix.
2. A `SortCommandParser` object invokes its `parse` method which parses the user input.
3. The `SortCommand` object is created with the parsed prefix.
4. A `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of the `SortCommand` object.
5. The `execute` method of the `SortCommand` object invokes the `updateSortedPersonList`, 
`updateSortedFilteredPersonList` and `commitAddressBook` methods of its `Model` argument to update and sort 
all contacts by the target prefix.
6. The `execute` method of the `SortCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding 
the completion of the `sort` command.

### Find feature

The `find` command allows users to search for contacts in Notarius based on specified fields: 
name, phone, email, address, and tags. The search is case-insensitive and supports multiple keywords. 
Additionally, for name, email, and address fields, the search is tolerant of minor typos, allowing matches within a Levenshtein distance of 2.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Ui" />
</p>

#### Implementation

1. The user enters the `find` command with the desired search criteria. 
2. The `LogicManager` invokes the parseCommand method of AddressBookParser to identify the command type. 
3. If the command is recognized as `find`, the `FindCommandParser` is instantiated. 
4. The `FindCommandParser` extracts the search parameters and keywords, ensuring correct parsing of multi-word inputs enclosed in double quotes (""). 
5. A new `FindCommand` object is created using the parsed search fields and keywords. 
6. The `LogicManager` executes the `FindCommand` object, which:
   1. Calls `updateFilteredPersonList` in `Model` to filter contacts based on the search fields and keywords. 
   2. Uses a case-insensitive check for all fields. 
   3. Applies Levenshtein distance â‰¤ 2 matching for `name`, `email`, and `address`. 
7. The `FindCommand` returns a `CommandResult`, displaying the filtered list of contacts matching the search criteria.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commit()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commit()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canundo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canredo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commit()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

allowing minor typos (up to a Levenshtein distance of 2) in the name, email, and address fields only. 
3. Address Book displays a list of matching contacts with index numbers.

   Use case ends.


**Extensions**:

* 1a. User enters an invalid search format. 
  * 1a1. Address Book alerts the user with an error message about the incorrect format. 
  * 1a2. User retypes the command following the correct format.<br>
    Steps 1a1-1a2 are repeated until the command format is valid.<br>
    Use case resumes from step 2.
* 2a. No contacts match the search criteria. 
  * 2a1. Address Book displays a message indicating that no matching contacts were found.<br>
    Use case ends.
* 2b. User enters multiple search fields. 
  * 2b1. Address Book searches for contacts that match any of the 
  specified fields (name, phone, email, address, or tags).<br>
    Use case resumes from step 3.
* 2c. User enters a keyword with minor typos in the phone or tag fields. 
  * 2c1. Address Book does not apply typo correction for phone numbers or tags. 
  * 2c2. If an exact match is not found, Address Book displays a message indicating no results were found.<br>
    Use case ends.
