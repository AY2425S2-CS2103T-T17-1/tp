### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, 
`PersonDetailPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` and `HelpWindow`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores states of the model in the ModelState in order to undo/redo the states.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### List feature

The `list` command enables users to view all existing contacts from Notarius.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Ui" />
</p>

#### Implementation Details

1. The user inputs the command to list all contacts.
2. A `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of a `ListCommand` object.
3. The `execute` method of the `ListCommand` object invokes the `updateFilteredPersonList` and
`commit` method of its `Model` to update and show all contacts.
4. The `execute` method of the `ListCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding
the completion of the `list` command.

### Help feature

The `help` command allows users to view general application usage instructions or specific details about a command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/HelpCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Ui" />
</p>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `HelpCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

#### Implementation Details

1. The user inputs the command to request help, either as help for general help or help COMMAND_NAME for details on a specific command. 
2. A `HelpCommandParser` object invokes its `parse` method, which parses the user input:
   1. If no argument is provided, it returns a `HelpCommand` object for general help. 
   2. If a valid command name is provided, it returns a `HelpCommand` object with that command name. 
3. A `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of the `HelpCommand` object. 
4. The execute method of the HelpCommand object checks if a command name was specified:
   1. If no command name is provided, it returns a `CommandResult` containing general help instructions. 
   2. If a valid command name is provided, it retrieves the corresponding help message from a predefined command-help mapping (`COMMAND_HELP`). 
   3. If an invalid command name is provided, it returns an error message stating that the command is unknown. 
5. The `execute` method of the `HelpCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object that stores the help message or error message. 
6. The application displays the help message to the user, either in a popup window (for general help) or in the main interface (for specific commands).

### Clear feature

The `clear` command enables users to remove all existing contacts from Notarius.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Ui" />
</p>

#### Implementation Details

1. The user inputs the command to clear all contacts.
2. A `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of a `ClearCommand` object.
3. The `execute` method of the `ClearCommand` object invokes the `setAddressBook` and `commit` method 
of its `Model` argument with a new `AddressBook` object which contains an empty `UniquePersonList` property.
4. The `execute` method of the `ClearCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding 
the completion of the `clear` command.

### Sort feature

The `sort` command enables users to sort contacts in Notarius by prefix in lexicographical order.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Ui" />
</p>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

#### Implementation Details

1. The user inputs the command to sort contacts with the specified prefix.
2. A `SortCommandParser` object invokes its `parse` method which parses the user input.
3. The `SortCommand` object is created with the parsed prefix.
4. A `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of the `SortCommand` object.
5. The `execute` method of the `SortCommand` object invokes the `updateSortedPersonList`, 
`updateSortedFilteredPersonList` and `commit` methods of its `Model` argument to update and sort 
all contacts by the target prefix.
6. The `execute` method of the `SortCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding 
the completion of the `sort` command.

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How to implement the sort command**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Support multi-level sorting for up to two attributes, with tags as first attribute
  * Pros: It is easier for users to understand and use. Sorting by tags first allows contacts to be grouped into respective clusters, making it easier to find related contacts.
  * Cons: For users with complex needs, limiting sorting to two attributes may be restrictive. They may need the ability to sort by more attributes to meet their requirements.

* Alternative 2: Support multi-level sorting for more than two attributes
  * Pros: Advanced users with specific needs (e.g., sorting by tag, then name, then phone number) can get more control and precision in how they organize their contacts.
  * Cons: It might slow down the system, especially if the dataset is large or if sorting requires a lot of computation. 

### Find feature

The `find` command allows users to search for contacts in Notarius based on specified fields: 
name, phone, email, address, and tags. The search is case-insensitive and supports multiple keywords. 
Additionally, for name, email, and address fields, the search is tolerant of minor typos, allowing matches within a Levenshtein distance of 2.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Ui" />
</p>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

#### Implementation Details

1. The user enters the `find` command with the desired search criteria. 
2. The `LogicManager` invokes the parseCommand method of AddressBookParser to identify the command type. 
3. If the command is recognized as `find`, the `FindCommandParser` is instantiated. 
4. The `FindCommandParser` extracts the search parameters and keywords, ensuring correct parsing of multi-word inputs enclosed in double quotes (""). 
5. A new `FindCommand` object is created using the parsed search fields and keywords. 
6. The `LogicManager` executes the `FindCommand` object, which:
   1. Calls `updateFilteredPersonList` and `commit` method in `Model` to filter contacts based on the search fields and keywords. 
   2. Uses a case-insensitive check for all fields. 
   3. Applies Levenshtein distance â‰¤ 2 matching for `name`, `email`, and `address`. 
7. The `FindCommand` returns a `CommandResult`, displaying the filtered list of contacts matching the search criteria.

#### Design Considerations

* Lenient Matching Using Levenshtein Distance
    * The `find` command supports typo-tolerant search using Levenshtein distance, 
but only for fields where user errors are likelyâ€”such as `name`, `email`, and `address`. <br>
    * This was a deliberate design choice to improve usability, allowing users to find contacts even with small typing mistakes.
* Default Field Matching Behavior
  * If no prefix is provided (e.g. `find Al`), the system assumes the user is searching by `name`.
  * This decision was made to streamline common use cases, since most searches tend to be name-based.


### Delete feature

The `delete` command allows the user to delete specified client contact(s) from Notarius.

The sequence diagram below models the different components of the application that are involved
when the user executes the `delete` command.
![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

#### Implementation Details

1. The user executes a command to delete a contact by specifying the contact's index.
2. The `LogicManager` receives the command and calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `AddressBookParser` creates a `DeleteCommandParser` object, which creates a `MassOpsIndexParser` object for parsing multiple indexes.
4. The `AddressBookParser` then calls the `parse` method of the newly created `DeleteCommandParser` object.
5. If the delete method specifies the `i/` prefix with the corresponding value being either a ranged format (`startIndex-endIndex`) or spaced format (`index1 index2 ... indexN`), the `parse` method of `MassOpsIndexParser` will be called to parse the indexes.
6. A new `DeleteCommand` object is created with the returned set of unique indexes from the parser, and gets returned back to the `LogicManager`.
7. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of the `DeleteCommand` object.
8. The `DeleteCommand` object calls the `Model#deletePerson` method for each of the set of unique indexes in decreasing order of the index's `zeroBasedIndex`.
9. After all `indexes` specified have been deleted, `Model#commitAddressBook` is called on the `Model` argument to save the changes made to the list of persons in the addressbook.

#### Usage Examples

1. User starts Notarius
2. User executes `delete i/1-3`
3. The client contacts with indexes 1, 2 and 3 will be deleted from Notarius. This change should be reflected in the client contact list.

**Aspect: How to implement the delete command**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Support deletion of multiple client contacts with intuitive delete formats
    * Pros: Intuitive to use, and improved user-friendliness. Users do not have to repeatedly type the same command to delete clients one-by-one.
    * Cons: More complicated to implement, due to the need of parsing multiple indexes, ignoring duplicates, and ensuring valid parsing according to the multiple specified formats.

* **Alternative 2:** Support deletion of only one client contact at a time using a single format
    * Pros: Simpler to implement, as the command will only need to parse one index.
    * Cons: Less user-friendly, as users will have to spend more time and trouble to repeatedly type the same command to delete potentially many clients one-by-one.


### Command history

The command history allows the user to re-access previously entered commands quickly.


The following sequence diagram models the interaction within the `Model` component called by `LogicManager#execute`
when the user executes a command to **save command inputs**.
![AddCommandHistorySequenceDiagram](images/AddCommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png)

#### Implementation Details: Saving commands to command history

1. When a user enters a non-empty command, the `ModelManager#addPastCommandInput` method will be called when the command text in `LogicManager` component is non-empty.
2. The `ModelManager` calls `CommandHistory#addInput` and passes the non-empty command text as argument.
3. If the command history's most recently added command is `equal` to the command text argument, the command text is not re-added again.
4. Otherwise, if the command history is currently full, with `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE` entries (set to 20), the earliest added command entry will be removed.
5. The `CommandHistory` object will add the command to `pastCommands`.

Note that `pastCommands` is an `ObservableList` sorted from most to least recent at the tail of the list.

<br>

The following sequence diagram models the main components involved when a user moves up the command history selection
using the `Ctrl + Up` key combinations on Windows (or `Ctrl + Opt + Up` on macOS), to **re-access previous commands**.
![CommandHistorySequenceDiagram](images/CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png)

#### Implementation Details: Re-accessing command history

1. When the user presses `Ctrl + Up`, the subscribed for the `EventHandler<KeyEvent>` JavaFX listener will be called.
2. The listener then calls `handleMovementUp` method of the `CommandHistoryMenu` in the Ui module.
3. The `CommandHistoryMenu` object calls the `moveUp` method of an internal `CommandHistoryMenuController` object to handle the logic
   of decrementing the index.
4. In `moveUp` then sets the current input of the `CommandBox` object through a call to `CommandBox#setCommandTextField` with the selected previous command.
5. The `CommandHistoryMenu` object then gets a result of this selection update by calling `CommandHistoryMenuController#getCommandSelectionIndex`
6. If the index is present within this result, the `CommandHistoryMenu` object gets the `SelectionModel` for rendering the given list cell of `ListView`
7. The `select` method of the `SelectionModel` object is then called with the index passed as argument.


#### Usage Examples
1. User launches Notarius
2. User enters a non-empty command.
3. User re-accesses the previously entered command using the command history shortcuts:
    * Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Up`/`Ctrl + Down` to move up/down the selection.
    * macOS: `Ctrl + Opt + Up`/ `Ctrl + Opt + Down` similarly.


**Aspect: Command history design considerations**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Support addition of some invalid commands, with duplicate handling for consecutively entered inputs
    * Pros: More user-friendliness, allows users to re-access and quickly re-edit past commands, if they have typed them wrong by accident, without having to retype the entire command.
    * Cons: May slightly clutter the command history with invalid commands if the user spams **different** invalid commands intentionally, which is not the intended behaviour.

* **Alternative 2:** Support addition of only valid commands
    * Pros: Allows users to find previously entered valid commands that they want to repeat.
    * Cons: Less user-friendly, since users will not be able to re-access previously entered commands that they have typed incorrectly, and will have to retype the entire command again.


### Note feature
The note feature allows the user to change and view notes. \
The user changes notes via the `note` command and the user views notes via the `viewnote` command.

#### Implementation Details

This is how a user changes their note via the `note` command:
1. The user inputs the command to change their note of a contact of a specific index.
2. A `NoteCommandParser` object invokes its `parse` method which parses the user input.
3. The `NoteCommand` object is created with the parsed prefix and specified index.
4. A `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of the `NoteCommand` object.
5. The `execute` method of the `NoteCommand` object modifies the specified clientContact with a new note invokes the `setPerson`,
and `commit` methods of its `Model` argument to change the note of the person.
6. The `execute` method of the `NoteCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding
   the completion of the `note` command.

This is how a user views their note via the `viewnote` command:
1. The user inputs the command to view a note of a contact of a specific index.
2. A `ViewNoteCommandParser` object invokes its `parse` method which parses the user input.
3. The `ViewNoteCommand` object is created with the specified index.
4. A `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of the `ViewNoteCommand` object.
5. The `execute` method of the `ViewNoteCommand` object invokes the getFilteredPersonList of the `Model` and gets the note of the clientContact as the specified index and
   does the `commit` method of the `Model` as well.
6. The `execute` method of the `ViewNoteCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding
   the completion of the `viewnote` command, if successful includes the note of the client contact at the specified index.

### Undo/redo feature
The `undo` and `redo` commands undoes and redoes other commands respectively. 

#### Implementation Details

* The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `ModelState`. 
* The `ModelState` is a save state of the `Model`.
* The `ModelState` saves the `ReadOnlyAddressBook` and `Predicate<Person>` of the `Model`.
* 'ModelState' objects are stored in the `Model` as `stateHistory` which is an `ArrayList<ModelState>`.
* Undo/redo is facilitated by a `currentStatePointer` which points to the current `ModelState` in the `stateHistory`.

Additionally, the `Model` implements and exposes the following operations to facilitate the undo/redo process:
* `Model#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current `ModelState` in the `stateHistory`.
* `Model#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous `ModelState` from its `stateHistory`.
* `Model#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone `ModelState` from its `stateHistory`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `stateHistory` will be initialised with the initial `ModelState` of the newly initialised `Model`, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single `ModelState`.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book of the `Model`. The `delete` command calls `Model#commit()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `stateHistory` as a `ModelState`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted `ModelState`.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commit()`, causing another modified address book state in the newly created `ModelState` to be saved into the `stateHistory`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit()`, so the `ModelState` will not be saved into the `stateHistory`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous `ModelState`, and restores the `Model` to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0 pointing to the initial `ModelState`, then there are no previous `ModelState` states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#hasUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone `ModelState`, and restores the `Model` to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `stateHistory.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest `ModelState` state, then there are no undone `ModelState` to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#hasRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commit()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `stateHistory`, all `ModelState` states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**:

### 1. Allow for international phone number format to be entered

#### Current:
In phone input fields, user only can enter a number. This restricts the user from being able to enter country codes.
This would reduce the application's usefulness as an address book application due to its limitation of storing
international client contacts. 

#### Planned:
To enhance usability and global compatibility. We should allow the user to enter the country code along with the phone number 
in phone input fields.

### 2. Bulk tag deletion capability

#### Current:
Via the edit command, all tags can be deleted or tags can be replaced with new ones. 
However, If a singular client contact has many tags and the 
user wants to delete a few tags from them, this would be decently cumbersome as the user has to retype in the tags
they do not want to replace.

#### Planned:
Add a command to delete multiple tags from a client contact.

### 3. Support for longer notes.

#### Current:
Notes are entered through a command line and are designed to write short and simple notes. However, users may 
want to write longer notes with more formatting options. Longer notes may be cumbersome experience to view in the
command output.

#### Planned:
If we want to stick fully to a CLI, we can add longer multi-line notes by using a prompt-based input technique where 
the user can enter line after line by using the `note` command. When the user wants to stop entering lines of the note
they can type the command `donenote`. This can be enhanced by allowing formatting options such as bolding. Long notes
can also be displayed better by making the command output collapsible.

### 5. More specific error messages for `delete` command.

#### Current:
When the delete command fails to delete specified contact(s), 
the error message shows "Invalid command format!" followed by the delete command usage, instead of providing
useful information on why the command failed.

#### Planned:
The application should be able to provide more informative error messages such as "Maximum number of contacts exceeded" when
the maximum number of unique indexes specified for deletion exceeds 100, or for range-formats, when the start index and end index do not conform to the constraints
specified in the user guide.

### 6. Selecting a client contact in contact list

#### Current:
When a new command is called, the selected contact in the contact list will be unselected by the application.

#### Planned:
The client contact will still be selected even though a new command is called. In addition, users can have the option to select or unselect the client contact.
